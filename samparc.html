                    <h3>About Our Founder</h3>
               
                <p>
                Working since 1984 for the children, Amitkumar Banerjee realized that children need an integrated support for development. At that time children of socially victim women, children of convicts received no support from government or any agency. Mr.Banerjee felt that every child needs shelter, care and protection and opportunity to grow.Mr. Banerjee felt that more than the identity as an orphan, a child needs to be considered from the point of view of present helpless situation.<br>
